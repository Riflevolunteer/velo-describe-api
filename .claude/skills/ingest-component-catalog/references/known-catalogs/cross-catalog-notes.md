## Cross-catalog notes

- The Nuovo Record 1020/A rows are dated per version in the DB (v3 1970-81,
  v4 1982-84, v5 1985-87); the bike generator's year-ranged override follows
  those. Keep them in step if either changes.
- Part numbers are reused across eras (1013/1 is a Gran Sport lever in 1953
  and a Record lever in 1967; 1040 is Gran Sport pista in 1960 and "Record
  Pista" later). Diff by number, then read the DB title before deciding.
- **Redundant velobase weights (2026-10-01, Simplex, at the user's
  call):** done when descriptions were still treated as add-only (since relaxed: velobase is not the authority, see SKILL.md). A
  velobase "(Spec)" weight was removed only where it exactly equals a
  catalogue weight for the same model on the same row. Removed text, so
  it can be restored: 2575 "126 grams (Spec)", 4616 "287 grams (Spec)",
  6209 "71 grams (Spec)", 6216 "86 grams (Spec)", 7263 "108 grams
  (Spec)" (each sat right after "France, "). Kept on purpose: every
  "(Actual)" and "(avg)" weight (measured specimens are independent
  evidence of real variance), (Spec) weights that only approximately
  match (6212 105 vs 105.5g, 4603, 4632), derived matches (6231 180g =
  2x90g), rows where the catalogue note doesn't restate the weight
  (2567, 6240), and 4617, where the weight anchors the SP wording.
  Weights on catalogue-inserted rows (e.g. 7281-7284, 7305) are
  themselves catalogue figures, not velobase ones.
- **Description/title sweep (2026-10-02, Simplex + Shimano 1972, after
  the "velobase is not the authority" rule).** 54 rows that had collected
  stacked "1978 catalog: ... Sep 1981 catalog: ..." fragments were
  rewritten into one consolidated description each (what the part is,
  then each figure with its catalogue year). Dropped: merge audit notes
  (the deleted rows are recorded above), velobase "(Spec)" weights that
  repeated a catalogue figure, and stale qualifiers. Kept: measured
  "(Actual)"/"(avg)" weights and "aka Super LJ ..." names. 4615 S0 gained
  the Sep 1981 S0/P figures (250g, 28t) that hadn't fit before. 6181 was
  also taken out of group 141 "Light Action". Old titles, so later
  sources using them can still be matched:
  - Shimano: 4498 "Crane D-501" -> "D500 / DB-100, Crane"; 4499 "Crane GS
    D-510" -> "D510 / DB-110, Crane G.S."; 4439 "Lark-W" -> "D280 /
    DD-300, Lark-W"; 4437 "D-600 Titlist" -> "D600, Titlist"; 4438
    "D-610 Titlist-GS" -> "D610, Titlist G.S."; 4444 "Eagle-SS" -> "D310,
    Eagle S.S."; 2461 "Thunder Bird GTO" -> "E111, Thunder Bird G.T.O.";
    6163 "L-600 Fingertip Control Barcons" -> "L600, Bar-End Control";
    6181 "L-422, Light Action" -> "L422, G.T. Console (5D)"; 6124/6120
    "Super Shifter (single)/(twin)" (originally both "Super Shifter") ->
    "L251, Super Shifter (single)" / "L252, Super Shifter (twin)".
  - Simplex: 2549 "302" -> "SJ A302"; 2576 "SJ A223 (triple)", 7264 "SLJ
    A423 (triple)", 2574 "SJ A103 (Triple)" -> suffix dropped; 4617 "SX
    810 T" -> "SX810 T"; 5904 "SLJ 6164" -> "SLJ6164"; 6209 "(Zytel
    levers, square finger pads)" -> "S3448"; 6231 "MB Silver Range" ->
    "MB2600"; 6212 "SJ (2nd type)" -> "SJ6311"; 6240 "SLJ (4th type,
    black anodized)" -> "SLJ5057 (black anodized)"; 6239 "SLJ (4th
    type)" -> "SLJ5057"; 6216 "SXP (2nd type; stem mount)" -> "SXP 4506".
